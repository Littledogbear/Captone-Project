### 2.5 Attribution Engine Testing
```bash
# Test attribution functionality
python test_attribution_with_specific_samples.py
```

Expected results:
- Attribution engine should analyze malware samples
- Identify potential threat actors based on techniques and tools
- Generate confidence scores for attributions
- Create attribution reports in JSON format

### 2.6 Report Generation Testing
```bash
# Test report generator
python test_updated_report_template.py
```

Expected results:
- Report generator should create HTML reports
- Reports should include all required sections (Executive Summary, Behavior Summary, etc.)
- Malware samples section should display correctly
- Confidence scores should be displayed as whole numbers

## 3. Integrated System Testing

### 3.1 Dashboard Testing
```bash
# Start the monitoring dashboard
python run_monitoring_dashboard.py
```

Access the dashboard at: http://127.0.0.1:8082

Testing steps:
1. Verify all dashboard tabs are accessible
2. Check system monitoring displays CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
3. Verify alerts tab shows security alerts with appropriate severity levels
4. Test knowledge graph generation functionality
5. Test report generation functionality

### 3.2 Comprehensive System Testing
```bash
# In a separate terminal (with virtual environment activated)
python test_comprehensive_system_with_specific_samples.py
```

Expected results:
- System should process multiple malware samples
- Generate alerts for each detected malware
- Create knowledge graphs showing attack patterns
- Generate comprehensive security reports
- Display attribution information for each sample

### 3.3 Real-time Monitoring Testing
```bash
# Test real-time monitoring with fixed confidence display
python test_real_time_monitoring_with_fixed_confidence.py
```

Expected results:
- System should monitor for suspicious activities in real-time
- Generate alerts when suspicious activities are detected
- Display alerts in the dashboard with appropriate severity levels
- Show confidence scores as whole numbers

## 4. Malware Simulation Testing

### 4.1 Prepare Malware Samples
```bash
# Download specific malware samples for testing
python test_specific_malware_samples.py
```

This will download the following samples:
- TrojanSample.exe
- RansomwareSample.exe
- BotnetSample.exe

### 4.2 Simulate Malware Detection
```bash
# Run the attribution dashboard test with samples
python run_attribution_dashboard_test.py
```

This will:
1. Process the malware samples
2. Generate alerts for each detected malware
3. Create knowledge graphs showing attack patterns
4. Generate security reports with attribution information
5. Display all results in the dashboard

### 4.3 Verify Detection Results
Access the dashboard at: http://127.0.0.1:8082 and verify:
1. Alerts are generated for each malware sample
2. Knowledge graphs correctly visualize attack patterns
3. Reports include all required sections
4. Attribution information is correctly displayed

## 5. End-to-End Testing

### 5.1 Run End-to-End Workflow Test
```bash
# Test the complete workflow
python test_final_end_to_end_workflow.py
```

This test will:
1. Download malware samples from MalwareBazaar
2. Process the samples using the AI analyzer
3. Generate knowledge graphs for each sample
4. Create attribution reports
5. Generate comprehensive security reports
6. Display all results in the dashboard

### 5.2 Verify End-to-End Results
Verify that:
1. All components work together seamlessly
2. No errors are reported during the workflow
3. All outputs (graphs, reports) are correctly generated
4. Dashboard displays all information correctly

## 6. Performance Testing

### 6.1 Test with Multiple Malware Samples
```bash
# Test with multiple malware samples
python test_multi_malware_samples.py
```

This will process multiple malware samples simultaneously to test system performance.

### 6.2 Verify Performance Results
Verify that:
1. System can handle multiple samples without errors
2. Processing time is reasonable
3. All outputs are correctly generated
4. No memory leaks or performance degradation occurs

## 7. Documentation Verification

### 7.1 Verify Documentation
Review the following documentation files to ensure they are accurate and complete:
- `docs/ai_analyzer_implementation.md`
- `docs/ai_analysis_integrator.md`
- `docs/attribution_engine.md`
- `docs/knowledge_graph_builder.md`
- `docs/report_generator.md`

### 7.2 Verify Setup Guide
Review the VMware Fusion setup guide to ensure it provides accurate instructions for:
- Environment setup
- Dependency installation
- API key configuration
- Running the application

## 8. Test Result Documentation

For each test, document:
1. Test name and purpose
2. Steps performed
3. Expected results
4. Actual results
5. Pass/fail status
6. Any issues encountered

Create a test report summarizing all test results and any issues that need to be addressed.

## 9. Safety Considerations

When testing with malware samples:
- Ensure your virtual machine is isolated from your main network
- Do not execute malware samples directly
- Use the built-in analysis tools to examine samples safely
- Keep your VM software updated with security patches
