# AI Analyzer Implementation Documentation

## Overview
The AI analyzer in the Cyber Attack Tracer system uses transformer-based models for zero-shot classification of malware behavior and system traces. It integrates with multiple system components to provide comprehensive threat analysis.

## Core Components

### 1. AI Trace Analyzer
Located in `src/trace_collector/ai_trace_analyzer.py`, this component:
- Uses DistilBERT and RoBERTa models for classification
- Supports CPU-only operation by default
- Provides fallback mechanisms during model initialization
- Implements zero-shot classification for flexible analysis

Key methods:
```python
def classify_text(self, text: str, categories: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Zero-shot text classification using transformer models."""
    classification = self.zero_shot_classifier(
        sequences=text,
        candidate_labels=categories
    )
    return {label: score for label, score in zip(classification['labels'], classification['scores'])}
```

### 2. AI Analysis Integrator
Located in `src/analysis_engine/ai_analysis_integrator.py`, this component:
- Coordinates different AI analysis modules
- Aggregates results from multiple analyzers
- Handles multi-malware correlation
- Provides unified interface for other components

### 3. Attribution Engine Integration
Located in `src/attribution/attribution_engine.py`, this component:
- Uses AI analysis results to match threat actors
- Calculates attribution confidence scores
- Generates attribution assessments
- Maintains historical attribution data

### 4. Knowledge Graph Integration
Located in `src/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_builder.py`, this component:
- Visualizes AI-identified attack techniques
- Creates relationship graphs from analysis
- Maps system components to attack patterns
- Supports interactive graph exploration

### 5. Report Generator Integration
Located in `src/reporting/report_generator.py`, this component:
- Processes AI analysis into structured reports
- Generates security improvement suggestions
- Creates visualizations of AI findings
- Supports both HTML and JSON output

## AI Analysis Workflow

1. **Trace Collection**
   - System traces are collected from monitored environment
   - Traces include processes, network connections, files, registry
   - Platform-specific collectors handle different OS environments

2. **AI Classification**
   - Traces are processed through transformer models
   - Zero-shot classification identifies behaviors
   - Confidence scores calculated for each classification
   - Results aggregated across multiple analyses

3. **Pattern Analysis**
   - AI identifies suspicious patterns in traces
   - Multiple behaviors correlated into attack techniques
   - System resources monitored for anomalies
   - Real-time analysis updates threat assessments

4. **Attribution Analysis**
   - AI-identified techniques matched to threat actors
   - Geolocation and tool fingerprinting applied
   - Confidence scores calculated for attribution
   - Historical data used for pattern matching

5. **Visualization**
   - Knowledge graphs created from AI analysis
   - Attack techniques mapped to system components
   - Interactive visualization enables exploration
   - Relationships shown between different entities

6. **Reporting**
   - Comprehensive reports generated from AI analysis
   - Security improvements suggested based on findings
   - Visualizations included for better understanding
   - Both technical and executive summaries provided

## Model Implementation

The AI analyzer uses two main transformer models:
1. DistilBERT (`distilbert-base-uncased`)
   - Used for general text classification
   - Lightweight and CPU-friendly
   - Pre-trained on cybersecurity corpus

2. RoBERTa (`cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base`)
   - Used for zero-shot classification
   - Handles unknown threat patterns
   - Provides confidence scores for classifications

Models are initialized in background threads to prevent blocking:
```python
def _initialize_models(self):
    """Initialize transformer models in background thread."""
    try:
        self.zero_shot_classifier = pipeline(
            "zero-shot-classification",
            model="cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base",
            device=-1  # CPU-only mode
        )
        self.text_classifier = pipeline(
            "text-classification",
            model="distilbert-base-uncased",
            device=-1  # CPU-only mode
        )
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error initializing models: {str(e)}")
```

## Integration Points

1. **With Attribution Engine**
   ```python
   # AI analysis results used for attribution
   attribution_result = attribution_engine.attribute_attack(
       traces=system_traces,
       ai_analysis=ai_analyzer.analyze_system_traces(system_traces)
   )
   ```

2. **With Knowledge Graph**
   ```python
   # AI-identified techniques added to graph
   graph_builder.add_techniques(
       ai_analyzer.identify_techniques(system_traces)
   )
   ```

3. **With Report Generator**
   ```python
   # AI analysis included in reports
   report = report_generator.generate_report({
       "ai_analysis": ai_analyzer.get_analysis_results(),
       "system_traces": system_traces
   })
   ```

## Error Handling

The AI analyzer implements robust error handling:
- Fallback mechanisms when models are initializing
- Default analysis results when classification fails
- Graceful degradation of functionality
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## Performance Considerations

The system is optimized for CPU-only operation:
- Models configured for CPU inference
- Background thread initialization
- Efficient text processing
- Minimal memory footprint

## Security Features

The AI analyzer implements several security measures:
- No external API dependencies
- Local-only model execution
- Sanitized input processing
- Secure output handling

## Testing

The AI analyzer can be tested using:
```python
python test_comprehensive_system_with_specific_samples.py
```

This will:
- Test AI analysis with specific malware samples
- Verify integration with other components
- Generate test reports and visualizations
- Validate confidence score calculations
